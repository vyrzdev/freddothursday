***ToDo***

- Redis Server (Running locally on Pi, hosting on 127.0.0.1)
- Python script: 
    - Format Data as an iterable list of student objects with scores/monetary value as attributes.
    - Handle modification of said data.
    - NFC Card/User enrollment Ui/Utility.
    
***To Be Considered***
- Potentially, Redis may not be the best option for this. With the current system, the entire list of students will have to be fetched and then overwritten every time a single student's data needs to be modified.
